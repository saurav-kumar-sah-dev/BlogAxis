## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Request timeout" error**:
   - ‚úÖ Fixed: Email sending now happens in background
   - Contact form responds immediately
   - No more timeout issues

2. **"Email configuration not found"**:
   - Set the environment variables in Render
   - Redeploy the service

3. **"Authentication failed"**:
   - Use App Password for Gmail (not regular password)
   - Ensure 2FA is enabled

4. **"Connection timeout"**:
   - Check EMAIL_HOST and EMAIL_PORT
   - Try different email provider

5. **"Email sent but not received"** (NEW ISSUE):
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Check Gmail's "Less secure app access" settings
   - Try different email provider
   - Check server logs for delivery details

### Email Delivery Troubleshooting:

#### If emails are sent but not received:

1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**:
   - Gmail often filters automated emails
   - Look for emails from your configured EMAIL_USER

2. **Gmail Specific Issues**:
   - Enable "Less secure app access" (if using regular password)
   - Use App Password instead of regular password
   - Check Gmail's security settings

3. **Test Email Delivery**:
   ```bash
   # Test email sending
   curl -X POST https://blogaxis.onrender.com/api/contact/test-email
   
   # Check email configuration
   curl https://blogaxis.onrender.com/api/contact/email-config
   ```

4. **Alternative Email Providers**:
   - Try Outlook/Hotmail instead of Gmail
   - Use a dedicated email service like SendGrid
   - Consider using a business email account

5. **Check Server Logs**:
   - Look for "Email result" in Render logs
   - Check if messageId is generated
   - Verify accepted/rejected arrays

## Database Access

Contact submissions are stored in MongoDB with the following structure:

```javascript
{
  name: "User Name",
  email: "user@example.com", 
  subject: "Subject",
  message: "Message content",
  status: "pending", // pending, read, replied, closed
  submittedAt: Date,
  adminNotes: "Optional admin notes"
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set up email configuration** using the steps above
2. **Test the contact form** to ensure emails are sent
3. **Monitor the logs** in Render dashboard for any issues
4. **Consider adding admin dashboard** to view contact submissions

## Security Notes

- App passwords are more secure than regular passwords
- Environment variables are encrypted in Render
- Email credentials are not exposed in client-side code
- Contact form has rate limiting and validation
